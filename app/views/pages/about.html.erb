<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>“The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack of will.” – Vince Lombardi</p>

<p>I have been doing development for about a year now.  I have enjoyed the learning process that I have gone through and want to keep that process going in the right direction.  I have been given tasks and have delivered them in a timely mannor and given daily updates to the client or representative so they know whats going on with the project.</p>
